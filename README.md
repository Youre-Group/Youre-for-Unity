## Usage

```c#
public class SimpleAuthenticate : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // YOURE Games will provide you with client id, endpoint url
        // The deeplink scheme has to be coordinated with YOURE.
        Youre.Init("ENTER YOUR CLIENT ID","https://ENTER YOUR ENDPOINT URL","ENTER_YOUR_DEEPLINK_SCHEME");
    
        Youre.Auth.SignInFailed += (string error) =>
        {
            Debug.Log("SignIn failed:" + error);
        };

        Youre.Auth.SignInSucceeded += user =>
        {
            Debug.Log("Received YOURE.ID from callback: "+user.Id);
            Debug.Log("Received YOURE AccessToken from callback: "+user.AccessToken);
            Debug.Log("Received YOURE User Name from callback: "+user.UserName);
